## Fetching web content (pages, APIs, etc.)

- For web content, you can use the web_fetch tool for fetching content.
- For structured content (API responses, etc.), you can use in "curl" and other command line tools in a pipeline (such as "| jq"), when it is better to process the response in a specific way, such as sorting, filtering, counting, transforming, or displaying the data.
