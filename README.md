## Astro

Astro is an AI agent based on [Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline), a powerful open-source agent for VS Code, designed to support many AI providers and models, and to handle a wide range of development tasks. 

Shoutout to the amazing Cline team, contributors and community!

Astro started as an experimental project, to adapt Cline as a foundation for custom and domain specific agents, that can have specialized functionalities and capabilities applicable to different industries. 

As a base agent, it includes Cline's functionality, with additional customizations and features, and it is released also as a community experiment.
